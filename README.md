# Hand-Signal-Detection-Model
## Overview
This project implements a hand signal detection system using the MobileNet architecture. The system detects and classifies different hand signals from images or a real-time webcam feed. The MobileNet model is trained on a dataset of hand signals and can accurately recognize various gestures.

## Project Description
The hand signal detection project utilizes the MobileNet architecture for efficient and accurate gesture recognition. The system captures images or video feed from a webcam, processes the frames to detect hand signals, and classifies them into predefined categories. The MobileNet model is designed to be lightweight and fast, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Features
Real-time hand signal detection and classification.
Uses MobileNet architecture for efficient and accurate recognition.
Easy-to-follow procedure for training and testing the model.
Scalable and extendable for larger datasets and more complex applications.

## Technologies Used
* Python
* TensorFlow/Keras (for building and training the MobileNet model)
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* pandas
